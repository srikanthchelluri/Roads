# Roads

This is an Android application concept that I created the summer of 2015. It picks up the speed limit of the road via [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), finds the speed that the user is travelling at, and provides some feedback as to if the user is speeding or not (just by emitting a beep). Users can adjust the speed limit should OSM provide inaccurate information.

The source code merely provides a proof-of-concept and in the future, I may expand upon this app. For now, though, I am not working on this project.
